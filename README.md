## General Information
- It is required to understand what are possible factors which can give insight into loan defaulters and differentiate between the Fully Repaid customers while lending a loan from a consumer finance company.
- Background of your project -> Two types of risks are associated with the bankâ€™s decision:
 If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
 If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- Business problem solution -> Identifying the risky loan applicants who can be rejected which might cause loss to the business and also identifying good customers who can be a great addition to the business.
- The dataset used -> loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011. Along with the data dictionary which provides the description of the columns.

## Conclusions
- Interest rate played a key role when the customer defaulted that is the loans with higher rate of interest were observed to be defaulted.
- The residential status was a factor to consider while the customers defaulted like, the customers with rented house were more prone to be charged off.
- Inquiry since last six month was the major factor which has to be considered as it was observed that the defaulter had almost the double amount of inquiries compared to fully paid customers
