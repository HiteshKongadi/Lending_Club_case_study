## General Information
- It is required to understand what are possible factors which can give insight into loan defaulters and differentiate between the Fully Repaid customers while lending a loan from a consumer finance company.
- Background of your project -> Two types of risks are associated with the bankâ€™s decision:
 If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
 If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- Business problem solution -> Identifying the risky loan applicants who can be rejected which might cause loss to the business and also identifying good customers who can be a great addition to the business.
- The dataset used -> loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011. Along with the data dictionary which provides the description of the columns.
